# C# invalidation measurements

See the [engineering investigation](../../../../../../For%20Contributors/csharp-invalidation-investigation.md) for methodology, environment, interpretation and limitations.

Recorded 22 driver runs; 2 workload/mode groups; 22 fresh-driver parity checks. Each group has two warm-ups and eight measured samples.

All stage durations and allocations are inclusive. Do not sum nested or parallel stages. With n=8, nearest-rank p95 equals the maximum.
