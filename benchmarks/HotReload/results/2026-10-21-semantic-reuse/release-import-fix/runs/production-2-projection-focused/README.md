# C# invalidation measurements

See the [engineering investigation](../../../../../../../For%20Contributors/csharp-invalidation-investigation.md) for methodology, environment, interpretation and limitations.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: invalidation -->
Recorded 11 driver runs; 8 workload/mode groups; 11 fresh-driver parity checks. Each group has two warm-ups and eight measured samples.

| Project / file | Scenario | Binary / profiling | Initial ms | Median ms | Range ms | p95 ms | Components generated / reused | Diagnostics evaluated | Changed texts |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SemanticFixture / Siblings.akbura | localized-binding-sibling | production / off / enabled | 2122.17 | 17.70 | 14.77 - 19.72 | 19.72 | not measured / not measured | not measured | 1 |

All stage durations and allocations are inclusive. Do not sum nested or parallel stages. With n=8, nearest-rank p95 equals the maximum.
